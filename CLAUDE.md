## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **coaches**: Coach profiles and settings
- **clients**: Client information and preferences
- **craving_interventions**: Strategies for managing cravings
- **energy_interventions**: Tactics for motivation/movement
- **craving_incidents**: Records of craving episodes
- **movement_incidents**: Records of energy/motivation episodes
- **client_sos_messages**: Chat messages between clients and system

### Key Relationships
- Coaches have many clients
- Clients have many interventions (both craving and energy)
- Incidents track real-time client interactions
- Messages belong to specific incidents

## Core Features

### Coach Dashboard
- **Client Management**: Add, edit, and monitor clients
- **Intervention Library**: Customize strategies for clients
- **Dashboard**: Overview of client activity and incidents
- **Profile Management**: Coach settings and customization

### Client Portal
- **Craving SOS**: Real-time support for food cravings
- **Energy Boost**: Real-time support for motivation and movement
- **PWA Capability**: Installable mobile app experience
- **Token-based Access**: Secure, shareable client links

### Conversation Flows

#### Craving SOS Flow
The craving support follows a structured conversation with AI-powered natural responses:
1. **WELCOME**: Initial greeting and assessment
2. **IDENTIFY_CRAVING**: Food selection and identification  
3. **GAUGE_INTENSITY**: Rate craving intensity (1-10)
4. **IDENTIFY_LOCATION**: Where the craving is happening
5. **IDENTIFY_TRIGGER**: Context/emotional trigger
6. **SUGGEST_TACTIC**: AI-powered intervention suggestion
7. **ENCOURAGEMENT**: Support during intervention
8. **RATE_RESULT**: Post-intervention effectiveness rating
9. **CLOSE**: Session completion

#### Energy Boost Flow (NEW - Aug 2025)
The energy/motivation support follows a parallel 6-step conversation structure:
1. **WELCOME**: Initial greeting and energy assessment
2. **IDENTIFY_BLOCKER**: What's preventing movement (tired, no time, not motivated, etc.)
3. **GAUGE_ENERGY**: Rate current energy level (1-10)
4. **IDENTIFY_LOCATION**: Where they are (home, gym, work, outdoors)
5. **IDENTIFY_GOAL**: Activity preference (quick boost, light movement, full workout)
6. **SUGGEST_TACTIC**: AI-powered energy intervention suggestion
7. **ENCOURAGEMENT**: Support during activity
8. **RATE_RESULT**: Post-activity energy level rating
9. **CLOSE**: Session completion

### AI Integration (GPT-4.1-mini)
**Enhanced Coach Responses**: The conversation flow uses OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini to generate natural, contextual coach responses while maintaining the structured data collection process.

**Smart Intervention Selection**: New AI-powered system intelligently selects primary and secondary interventions based on comprehensive client context.

**Key Features:**
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI responses reference client name, specific food craving, intensity level, location, and trigger
- **Natural Language**: Conversations feel more human-like while preserving therapeutic structure
- **Smart Interventions**: LLM selects most effective interventions based on craving type, intensity, location, trigger, time of day, and client's available strategies
- **Dual Selection**: AI picks both primary and secondary interventions simultaneously, ensuring no duplication
- **Intelligence Factors**: Considers intervention categories, complementary strategies, time-based appropriateness, and contextual effectiveness
- **Robust Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback to hardcoded responses if AI service fails
- **Cost Efficient**: Using GPT-4.1-mini (~$0.0005 per conversation + ~$0.002 per smart selection) for optimal cost-performance balance
- **Personalized Tone**: AI adopts the coach's persona and maintains warm, non-judgmental communication

**Implementation:**
- `src/lib/openai/coach-ai.ts`: OpenAI service with step-specific prompts
- `src/app/api/ai/smart-interventions/route.ts`: Smart intervention selection endpoint using GPT-4.1-mini
- `src/lib/client-portal/smart-interventions.ts`: Client-side functions for intelligent intervention selection
- Context tracking across conversation steps for personalized responses
- Error handling with graceful degradation to standard responses
- Smart selection triggered automatically when all context is collected (food, intensity, location, trigger)

- Bypasses auth for client portal routes
- Supabase session management

### Database Utilities (`src/lib/client-portal/craving-db.ts`)
Database operations for client portal:
- Client/coach information retrieval
- Incident creation and updates
- Message storage and retrieval

## Styling System

### CSS Variables

- Remove selectedFood references from craving conversation flow
- Persist selected food across conversation steps
- Simplified craving prompt text for better user engagement

## Critical Bug Fixes (Aug 2025)

### Energy Boost "No Interventions" Bug Resolution
**Root Cause**: Missing RLS (Row Level Security) policy prevented client portal from accessing `energy_interventions` table.

**Symptoms**: 
- Energy Boost showed "I don't have any interventions configured" despite 25+ interventions in database
- Client ID was correct, database queries worked in backend, but frontend received empty results
- Craving SOS worked perfectly with identical code structure

**Solution**: Added missing RLS policy:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "client_portal_read_energy_interventions" ON "public"."energy_interventions"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT TO public USING (true);
```

**Key Lesson**: When client portal queries return empty results but backend queries succeed, always check RLS policies first. Client portal runs with anonymous/public access and needs explicit read permissions for each table.

**Related Fixes**:
- Added button emojis to Energy Boost (👍 💡) for UI consistency
- Implemented complete secondary intervention flow matching Craving SOS
- Cleaned up debug logging and function name collisions

## Development Notes

### Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint with Next.js configuration
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Component composition pattern

### Database Patterns
- UUID primary keys
- Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
- JSON fields for flexible data storage
- Soft deletes with active/inactive status

### Security Policies (RLS)
**IMPORTANT**: All database tables are protected with Row Level Security (RLS). Security audit completed Aug 2025.

**Key Security Features:**
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Coaches can only access their own clients and data
- **Token-based client access**: Client portal validates access via `get_client_from_token()`
- **Anonymous client portal access**: Secure policies for client-side Supabase operations
- **Comprehensive policies**: 35+ RLS policies across 11 tables ensuring data privacy
- **Helper functions**: Secure ownership validation with proper `search_path` settings

**Security Functions:**
- `public.get_client_from_token()`: Validates client portal access via token (header-based)
- `public.user_owns_client(uuid)`: Checks if authenticated coach owns a client
- `public.user_owns_message_incident(uuid, text)`: Validates coach access to messages
- `public.client_owns_message_incident(uuid, text)`: Validates client access to messages

**Access Patterns:**
- **Coaches (authenticated)**: Own clients, interventions, incidents, messages only
- **Client Portal (anonymous/public)**: 
  - Create/view incidents for valid token-holding clients
  - Create/view messages for valid incidents
  - View coach info for their assigned coach
  - Update own client data (limited fields)
- **Server-side (service_role)**: Token validation queries for authentication
- **Default Tables**: Read-only access for reference data

**Client Portal RLS Policies:**
- `client_portal_view_coaches`: Access coach data for token-validated clients
- `client_portal_create_incidents`: Create craving/movement incidents
- `client_portal_create_messages`: Save chat messages to incidents
- `client_portal_view_messages`: View incident message history
- `allow_anonymous_token_validation`: Enable token-based authentication
- `allow_server_token_validation`: Enable server-side token validation

### Error Handling
- Silent fallbacks for client portal functionality
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Console logging for debugging

## Testing Strategy
No test framework currently configured. Consider adding:
- Jest for unit tests
- Playwright for e2e tests
- React Testing Library for component tests

## Deployment Considerations
- Next.js production build required
- Environment variables must be configured
- Supabase database migrations needed
- PWA assets generated during build
